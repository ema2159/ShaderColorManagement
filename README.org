This project consists of implementing Lookup table-based (LUT) color management, with four different types of interpolation. The implementation is built using GLSL, rendering the result in a Three.js scene.

The interpolation methods implemented are:
- Nearest neighbors interpolation
- Trilinear interpolation
- Prism interpolation
- Tetrahedral interpolation
